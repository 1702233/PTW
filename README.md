Herkansing PTW (Gideon, Pieter, Santosh, Yannick en Thijs)

This application is a proof of concept for a steamclient connecting to a raspberry pi(server) to show different functionalities based on what the user is doing.

Make sure Python3 is installed and used to run these programs.
1. Run the file TI-basisopdracht.py the server.
2. Run the file TkinterGUI.py the client.
3. Press the button on the serverside to initialize the GUI*
4. Use GUI widgets to activate functionalities

*if no connection can be made with the server at all, the GUI will start in offline mode and none of the server functionalities will work.


This repository also contains data analysation of the provided steam data in steam.json
